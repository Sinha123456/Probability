# Statistics

Descriptive statistics is about describing our collected data. 

Inferential Statistics is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population


   1. Population - our entire group of interest.
   2. Parameter - numeric summary about a population
   3. Sample - subset of the population
   4. Statistic numeric summary about a sample


    The sampling distribution is centered on the original parameter value.

    The sampling distribution decreases its variance depending on the sample size used. Specifically, 
    the variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the variance of the original data divided by the sample size used.
    This is always true for the variance of a sample mean!
